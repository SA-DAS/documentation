## v1.2.0 release on testnet - 2023-12-08

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice for CCIP v1.0.0 on Testnet">
  CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on testnet. You must use the new router addresses mentioned in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet) **before January 31st, 2024**. Please note that there is
  no change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0.0 testnet routers will continue to function in parallel **until
  January 31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2.0 routers as soon as possible. If you currently
  use CCIP v1.0.0, use the [@chainlink/contracts-ccip npm package version
  0.7.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/0.7.6). To migrate to v1.2.0, use [version 1.2.1 of
  the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/1.2.1) or later.
</Aside>

- There is no change to the router interface, but you must use the new router addresses mentioned in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet).
- Added support for USDC transfers. USDC transfers are currently supported on the following lanes:

  - From Optimism Goerli to Avalanche Fuji.
  - From Optimism Goerli to Base Goerli.
  - From Avalanche Fuji to Optimism Goerli.
  - From Avalanche Fuji to Base Goerli.
  - From Base Goerli to Optimism Goerli.
  - From Base Goerli to Avalanche Fuji.

  Refer to the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet) to get a specific lane's token addresses and rate limits.

- We've simplified the message sequencing process in our CCIP message handling by removing the `strict` sequencing flag from the [extraArgs](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmextraargsv1) field in [CCIP messages](/ccip/api-reference/client#evm2anymessage).

- The gas limit and maximum message data length for CCIP messages have been adjusted on testnets. These changes are detailed in the [Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits) documentation.

- To interact with CCIP v1.2.0 , use the [@chainlnk/contract-ccip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip) npm package.
