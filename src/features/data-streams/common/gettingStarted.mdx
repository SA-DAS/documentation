Read data from a Data Stream and validate the answer onchain. This example uses a [Chainlink Automation Log Trigger](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to check for events that require data. For this example, the log trigger comes from a simple emitter contract. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Engine, return the data in a callback, and run the [`performUpkeep` function](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#performupkeep-function-for-log-triggers) on your registered upkeep contract. The `performUpkeep` function calls the `verify` function on the verifier contract.

## Before you begin

- Data Streams are currently available only in Early Access. Upkeeps for Data Streams will not run without first acquiring access. [Contact us](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/datastreams?#ref_id=docs) to talk to an expert before you deploy the example contracts in this tutorial.
- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract) so you are familiar with the tools that are necessary for this guide:
  - The [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language
  - The [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) wallet
  - The [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) development environment
- Acquire testnet funds. This guide requires a testnet ETH on _Arbitrum Sepolia_.
  - Use the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) to transfer testnet ETH from Ethereum Sepolia to Arbitrum Sepolia. Testnet ETH is available at one of [several faucets](https://faucetlink.to/sepolia).
  - Testnet LINK is available for _Arbitrum Sepolia_ at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
- Learn how to [Fund your contract with LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract).

## Deploy the Chainlink Automation upkeep

Deploy an upkeep that is enabled to retrieve data from Data Streams. For this example, you will read from the ETH/USD stream with ID `0x00027bbaff688c906a3e20a34fe951715d1018d262a5b66e38eda027a674cd1b` on Arbitrum Sepolia. For a complete list of available assets, IDs, and verifier proxy addresses, see the [Stream Identifiers](/data-streams/stream-ids) page.

1. Select the Arbitrum Sepolia network in MetaMask.

1. Open the example upkeep in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeep.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. In the **Solidity Compiler** tab, select the `0.8.16` Solidity compiler and the `StreamsUpkeep` contract.

1. Compile the contract. You can ignore the warning messages for this example.

1. In the **Deploy & Run** tab, select **Injected Provider** as your Environment. For this example, you should be using Arbitrum Sepolia.

1. Deploy the contract with the following constructor variables:

   - **FeeAddress (WETH)**: `0xe39Ab88f8A4777030A534146A9Ca3B52bd5D43A3`
   - **VerifierAddress**: `0x2ff010DEbC1297f19579B4246cad07bd24F2488A`

1. Record the contract address.

## Deploy the emitter

This contract emits logs that trigger the upkeep. This code can be part of your dApp. For example, you might emit log triggers when your users initiate a trade or other action that requires data retrieval. For this Getting Started guide, we will use a very simple emitter so you can test the upkeep and data retrieval.

1. Select the Arbitrum Sepolia network in MetaMask.

1. Open the example emitter in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/LogEmitter.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Compile the contract.

1. In the **Deploy & Run** tab, select **Injected Provider** as your Environment.

1. Deploy the contract. Record the contract address.

## Register the upkeep

Register a new **Log Trigger** upkeep. See [Automation Log Triggers](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to learn more about how to register Log Trigger upkeeps.

1. Go to the [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) for Arbitrum Sepolia and connect your browser wallet.

1. Click **Register new Upkeep**.

1. Select the **Log Trigger** upkeep type and click **Next**.

1. Specify a name for the upkeep.

1. Specify the upkeep contract address that you saved earlier and click **Next**.

1. Specify the emitter contract address that you saved earlier. This tells Chainlink Automation what contracts to watch for log triggers.

1. Specify a **Starting balance** of 1 testnet LINK for this example. You can retrieve unused LINK later.

1. Leave the **Check data** value and other fields blank for now, and click **Register Upkeep**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

## Fund the upkeep contract

In this example, the upkeep contract pays for the verification. The Automation subscription does not cover that cost. Send LINK to your upkeep contract to pay for the verification costs.

In MetaMask, send 1 testnet LINK to your contract address before you proceed to the next step and trigger the upkeep.

## Emit a log

Now you can use your emitter contract to emit a log and initiate the upkeep, which retrieves data for the specified Data Streams asset ID.

1. Go to [sepolia.arbiscan.io](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/).

1. Under the **Deployed Contracts** list, click the **emitLog** button to run the function and emit a log. MetaMask prompts you to accept the transaction.

After the transaction is complete, the log is emitted and the upkeep is triggered. You can find the upkeep transaction hash at [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia). Check to make sure the transaction is successful.

## View the retrieved price

The retrieved price is stored as a variable in the contract and is also emitted in the logs.

1. In Remix, go to the **Deploy & Run** tab.

1. Under the **Deployed Contracts**, find the deployed upkeep contract and view the variables.

1. Click the `last_retrieved_price` variable to view the retrieved price.

Alternatively, you can view the price emitted in the logs for your upkeep transaction. You can find the upkeep transaction hash at [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) and view the logs in the explorer.

## Examine the code

The example code that you deployed has all of the interfaces and functions required to work with Chainlink Automation as an upkeep contract. It follows a similar flow to the trading flow in the [Architecture](/data-streams#example-trading-flow) documentation, but uses a basic log emitter to simulate the client contract that would initiate a `StreamsLookup`. After the contract receives and verifies the report, `performUpkeep` emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the price. You could modify this to use the data in a way that works for your specific use case and application.

The code example uses `revert` with `StreamsLookup` to convey call information about what streams to retrieve. See the [eip-3668 rationale](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668#rationale) for more information on the use of `revert` in this way.
